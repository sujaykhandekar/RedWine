# Red wine analysis by sujay

This project will apply exploratory data analysis techniques using R to a dataset about chemical properties of Red Wines in order to answer the following question: “Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?” The dataset to be explored contains information about 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. The quality of each wine is rated between 3(bad) and 8(good) by at least 3 wine experts.
